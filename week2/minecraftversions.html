    <h1>Different Versions of Minecraft</h1>
    <p>Minecraft was first created in 2009, and has since had many different versions. In 2014, Microsoft bought Minecraft for $2.5 billion dollars. Soon after, Microsoft created the "Bedrock" edition of Minecraft, which was coded in the C++ language rather than Java like the original game.</p>
    <p>The Bedrock version of Minecraft used in this course has minor differences to the original Java version.</p>
