# Week 2 - Introduction to Minecraft

The Minecraft video game has enormous educational value within computer science classrooms. Just consider what happens when a player starts a brand new world. Every world starts with a random "seed", which is used to procedurally generate **(algorithm)** the world and the blocks in it. Think of a Minecraft world as a 3D dimensional grid **(arrays)**, where every grid spot contains one of many possible blocks **(data structures)**. The player is free to try to break and collect the blocks **(object-oriented design)** into their inventory. The blocks and other items found throughout the game can be combined based on certain rules **(conditionals)**. The day alternates between daytime and nighttime **(iteration)**, but beware of nighttime when enemies will randomly spawn. If you don't eat food often enough you will might nearly starve to death, it's called Survival mode for a reason! Oh, did we mention that using the Bedrock or Education editions, players can open a complete programming environment with the push of a button?

## Creative Mode
Games serve as a not only a terrific way to *demonstrate* computational processes but also to *motivate* the player to explore these ideas in an active manner. For this course, we will use Minecraft as our *sandbox* to play with the fundamental concepts of computer science. Don't worry if you are not comfortable playing video games. We as computer science teachers look for ways to let students express their creativity through computers and computational thinking. The goal of this course is to provide a rigorous foundation in computer science, while introducing various resources to use in the classroom. We hope that by the end of this program you will have the confidence and competence to design educational activities that express your creativity as a teacher and person.
